# glTFMilo

A glTF to Milo scene converter. Converts a glTF/glB to a Milo scene, which is the format used by older Harmonix games to store pretty much anything that needed to be rendered. This is rather experimental so expect there to be random issues or things not quite appearing properly in-game.

Intended for Rock Band 3 at the moment, but may work with other games.

## Usage

`glTFMilo.exe <file.gltf/glb> <output.milo> ps3`

`glTFMilo.exe <file.gltf/glb> <output.milo> xbox`

No support for Wii yet, but this will be coming eventually.
